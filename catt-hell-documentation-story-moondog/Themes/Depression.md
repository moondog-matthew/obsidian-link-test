> Stories aren't written front-to-back, first page to last page. At least I don't do it that way. You can brainstorm questions, story beats, scenes, and dialogue specifically related to this topic here, and they can be integrated into the story later.

>This is a sensitive topic, and we should consult with people with autism we know when writing about this. 
>>[!note]+ Moondog
>>I understand several members of our writing team maybe/probably have depression, but still, it's good to get a variety of opinions. There are also multiple subthemes listed here, I assume not everyone has experience with all of those.

# Characters

## Poshya
Poshya has depression. Some ideas about the nature of Poshya's depression can be found [Here](Poshya.md##Depression).

## CATTs

>[!question]+ Do any of the CATTs suffer from depression? 
>>[!note]+ Moondog
>>Some of them probably do. CATT HELL must be a pretty depressing place to live, for them.


# Subthemes
## Social Withdrawal
Poshya feels like an embarassment to their family. Pos isn't hanging out with their friend [Ana](Ana.md), which they always enjoyed in the past.
[Legally Distinct Orange Cat](Legally%20Distinct%20Orange%20Cat.md) tries later to teach Pos the importance of hanging out with friends.

>[!Question]+ Why do depressed people do social withdrawal? - Moondog
>1. Feeling unworthy or inadequate, that people are only inviting you out of pity rather than actual social interest.
>2. Lack of Energy, staying in is easier.
>3. Struggles with time management, lack of motivation and productivity leading to overwhelming tasks to do and stress.
>4. Social Anhedonia. Hanging out with others no longers feels fun.
>5. History of Social Anxiety. This causes depression, which causes social withdrawal, which is a self-feeding loop.

## Self-Care


## Negative Self-Talk
Poshya regularly enjoys talking negatively about themselves, mostly when they're by themselves.
In CATT HELL, [EMPATHY](EMPATHY.md) will cause Poshya physical pain if they do negative self-talk.

## Wrath
Does Poshya take out their anger on others? 
[Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) certainly does take out their anger on others..

## Pride and Shame
[Heavenly Emperor](Heavenly%20Emperor.jpg) tries to teach Poshya to take pride in their work and their accomplishments, however small. 
[Kadet](Kadet.md) is a very prideful character, which is a flaw of theirs. 


## Substance Abuse
A problem Poshya deals with. Maybe hard drugs, maybe just things like cigarettes or beer. [Train](Train.md)'s owner was a dealer and a substance abuser, and tries to teach Poshya to quit. 

>[!note]+ Moondog
>I'm not very personally experienced on this subject, but I've been doing a lot of research/homework on this topic lately for a theatre project I'm in. I watched Trainspotting (1996) recently. In that movie, characters get on heroin for various reasons, including:
>- A man's girlfriend breaks up with him.
>- A woman's baby dies.
>- A group of men suffer from pure, unadulterated, boredom.
>
>I think the boredom case might be something Poshya relates to.



## Structure
Having to take care of [Bittles](Bittles.md) helps Poshya structure their life, at least a little bit. 
[Six](Six.md) teaches Pos some silly way to make sure they brush their teeth before bed every night.


## Regulating Burnout
CATT [Bittles](Bittles.md) tries to teach Poshya not to do too much at once. When Poshya is doing too much in CATT HELL, getting too damaged, Bittles can wake them up.

>[!Note]+ Scene Idea - Moondog
>CATT Bittles tells Poshya to not do too much at once. Poshya negatively compares themselves to others like their Dad who regularly go to work, and complains "How can I be doing too much!?  I'm hardly doing anything!"

## Panic Attacks
Does Poshya get panic attacks?
>[!Note]+ Scene Idea - Moondog
>Cat Bittles might help calm down Poshya during panic attacks, if they have them. We could take inspiration from this [Puss in Boots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDD2spyvIs4) scene where Puss has a panic attack, maybe for right as Poshya wakes up?

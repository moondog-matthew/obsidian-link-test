# Characters

## Poshya
Poshya probably *doesn't* have autism. 

## CATTs

### Butterstick
[Butterstick](Butterstick.md) is autism-coded, he has something similar to Asperger's Syndrome as described [here](https://www.medicinenet.com/what_are_the_5_different_types_of_autism/article.htm).
Butterstick is:
- Very studious. He will spend a long time thinking and talking about philosophy. 
- He struggles to grasp social situations sometimes. Fortunately, his friend [Legally Distinct Orange Cat](Legally%20Distinct%20Orange%20Cat.md) helps him out.
- He's actually happy he doesn't have to hunt for food in CATT HELL, it gives him more time to ponder.

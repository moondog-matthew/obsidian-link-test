>>
>>>[!Note]+ You're right, what am I thinking? 
>>>(Abandon Thought).
>>
>>>[!Note]+ \[ABSURDISM]: This isn't a cigarette.

>>>>(Abandon Thought)

>The cat follows you. It seems intent on coming home with you.
>>[!note]+ \[EMPATHY]: You're going to freeze out here if you stay, you've already lost an eye, kitty. *Pick up the cat, and bring it home with you.*

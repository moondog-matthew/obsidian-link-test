>We don't need to explicitly use the term "transgender" in our game, but I think making hints at the fact that one or more characters are trans could be interesting. I definitely think with the topics we're talking about in our game, that some of our audience will be transgender people. 

# Characters

## Poshya
[Poshya](Poshya.md) is a character of ambiguous gender to the reader. They are not *necessarily* transgender.

Using pronouns to describe Pos should be avoided. If it cannot be avoided, use they/them.
Possible nicknames Poshya or other characters use at them to avoid pronouning them:
- Poshya
- Pos
- Piece of Shit
- furball
- poker-face
- saggy-eyes

It is intended for the reader to be able to imagine themselves as Poshya, and so any reader (us as devs included) can use any pronouns for them, including in documents you write purely by yourself, but stick to they/them for documents we write in together, to avoid confusion. 
## Gold Standard
[Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) could be a transgender allegory.

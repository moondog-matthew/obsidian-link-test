# Characters

## Poshya
>[!question]+ Is [Poshya](Poshya.md) a vegetarian?
>>[!note]+ Moondog
>>Depends on the setting we go with. If we go with my idea for the [Background](Background.md), Poshya is living in fictionalized eastern europe, and therefore probably not. In a more modern, western setting, I think Poshya being vegetarian/vegan could be plausible, and interesting to work with. 

## CATTs
[Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) was abused as a cat in life by his owners.

[Train](Train.md) and [Heavenly Emperor](Heavenly%20Emperor.jpg) have both witnessed a lot of animal abuse in life, but also witnessed a lot of kindness from humans.

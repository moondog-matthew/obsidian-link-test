# Characters

## Poshya
Is [Poshya](Poshya.md)'s depression related to their living situation under capitalism? Probably.


## CATTs
[Train](Train.md) is ideologically literate. He hats cops, like a mailman to a dog, Train instinctively hisses at any cops he sees. He (somehow) knows the relation between capitalism and drug use, thanks to his former drug-dealer owner.

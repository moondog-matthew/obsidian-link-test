# README

This is the repository for documenting CATT HELL - this will cover it's game-play, aesthetics and writing.

## Pre-requisites

We can use whatever tool we want such as Obsidian [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to maintain this documentation but we don't have an offical tool. [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) may also be used, but do note that the extended markdown syntax specs are not the same for both, so you may not get the proper experience.

## Guide

- To leave a comment, use [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts), preferably an expanded [foldable callout](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Foldable%20callouts):

  ```md
  > [!note]+ Moondog
  > Maybe we shouldn't add a Monty Python reference here?
  ```

- At the time of writing, there are two [supported formats](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Supported+formats+for+internal+links) to link internally. Wikilink will not be used - instead, we will stick with the more common Markdown link. To link headers or files, make use of the markdown syntax:

## Generic androgynous person as placeholder art.

# Story
Pos is the protagonist, currently of ambiguous gender. Their name is short for 'Poshya', but they insist it's an acronym for "Piece of Shit". In this story, Pos is trying to learn to live with, or at least cope with, depression. They also suffer from self-loathing, and experience thoughts of nihilism.

At a pivotal point in their depression, Pos adopts a cat, [Bittles](Bittles.md). they're a rescue and they're very boring, they're also symbolic of recovering from depression. A task that is not exciting or interesting at all but rather mundane, boring and sometimes frustrating but ultimately worth doing, and interacting with [Bittles](Bittles.md) during 'real world' segments represents that.

## Depression
>[!question]+ Why is Poshya depressed?

>>[!note]+ Kochmach's Idea
>>Poshya is a 20-something creative person, they’ve finished their web design degree and are now taking a ‘gap year’ to discover themselves before they start working.  
>>
>>However the idea of working in web-design, which is often soul-crushing for people who are actually genuinely creative, is painful for Poshya. During the gap year she does a lot of reflection and comes to the (erroneous) conclusion that she’s only doing this because she’s pushed into it and that she hasn’t actually made a self-motivated choice in her life. 
>>
>>Dreading the future, on top of all her school friends now working and being too busy for her and without the structure of work or school, Poshya falls into a deep depression. She has no conscious self-care habits, so without external influences pushing her together she falls apart.

>>[!note]+ Moondog's Idea
>>Poshya is living in an eastern european country shortly after the fall of the USSR (or a fictionalized version of such a society). Due to economic shock therapy, Pos is no longer able to continue studying classical music (Piano, maybe violin?). Even if Pos could continue studying at their now-defunct university, the work prospects are bleak. Pos feels especially guilty because they have the highest education of anyone in their family, but are not putting it to any use.

# Appearance
Poshya might never be depicted with any picture in the game. If they are, they should have an androgynous appearance.

# Story
Friends with [Heavenly Emperor](Heavenly%20Emperor.jpg). They both lived in New York. Train's owner was a drug dealer and substance abuser himself, and Train witnessed it destroy his beloved owner. Also, Train hates cops. ACAB. He was a stray for a few years after, and befriended [Heavenly Emperor](Heavenly%20Emperor.jpg) during that time.

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Honestly does resonate with some of [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md)'s ideas about humans after a rough upbringing, but doesn't want to take revenge on humans. 

## Poshya's Conflict?
Train teaches Poshya the evils of substance abuse, and that they need to stop using short-term dopamine boosts and painkillers to get through the day. He cares deeply for Poshya, recognizing his owner in them, and wants them to get better.

## Scene ideas.
Train deals catnip to another cat. Maybe Poshya can buy from him, and Poshya can give the catnip to another cat as a gift.

# Appearance
This mf smoking a cigarette. He looks cool as hell

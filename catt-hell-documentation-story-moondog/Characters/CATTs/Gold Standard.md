# Story
Gold Standard was abused ([Animal Abuse](Animal%20Abuse.md)) in life. This motivates him being a mean bastard to others, but doesn't excuse it. If CATT HELL truly were punishment (which he believes it is), this truly would be a cruel world. He has abandoned the name his abusive owner gave him in life, and hates when other CATTs call him by his name his owners gave him.

>[Transgender](Transgender.md) cat? Trans allegory? Maybe. I only thought of this when I read Kochmach's pitch and noticed that Gold changes name halfway through the story.

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Gold Standard is the self-appointed leader of the CATTs who want to wreak havoc upon the humans. He is (one of?) the toughest and strongest CATTs in CATT HELL. He can't tell the difference between the pain that comes from EMPATHY, and the pain he endured in life. He might have multiple followers who are not named in the story.

## Poshya's Conflict?
>[!note]+ Moondog
>Poshya's original idea was for Gold Standard to be new to CATT HELL, and be tormenting Poshya in act 1. While the act 1 cliffhanger we lined out is great, I'd like it if Gold Standard could try to be sympathetic to Poshya early and teach them something. Maybe they're teaching Poshya a good lesson, but in a bad way. Gold might teach Poshya about pain by causing Poshya pain. Maybe they want to help Poshya by toughening them up, because Golden believes that's what you need to survive.

Gold Standard knows a lot about living with pain, and can teach Poshya some things about it to help them endure it.

# Story
The Supreme Mouser of New York State. Heavenly Emperor lived 10 years in NYC as a mouser, helping bodegas and other stores stay free of rats. Is tough enough to fight off a raccoon, but probably wouldn't. Doesn't start fights for no reason.

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Heavenly Emperor knows not all humans are evil, but doesn't know how to teach this to Gold. Has previously had to get [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) to back off from bullying others too hard.

## Poshya's Conflict?
Teaches Poshya to be brave, to focus on their craft and to take pride in their hard work.

# Appearance
Tough and hardy.

>If we don't get legal advice, we probably don't skirt the line on a Garfield Parody. If this bit is too much, maybe we just name him "Orange", and have a smaller reference to Garfield later.
# Story
A well-loved cat in life, Legally Distinct Orange Cat (Orange for short.) wasn't actually sent to CATT HELL, but requested to come here from cat heaven to hang out with his friend [Butterstick](Butterstick.md). They always hang out together (Orange kind of knows Butterstick wouldn't survive CATT HELL by himself).

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Him and [Butterstick](Butterstick.md) both empathize with Gold Standard, but can't get through to him. Gold is hard to reason with sometimes.

## Poshya's Conflict?
Teaches Poshya that helping people or making people happy can reflect back to you and make you feel good.

# Appearance
Looks like Garfield. Probably has a lasagna somewhere in the background art.

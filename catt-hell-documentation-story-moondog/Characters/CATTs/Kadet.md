# Story
Kadet is the oldest CATT in CATT HELL. She's been here since she died and was mummified in ancient Egypt, where she was revered as a goddess. Her near-godlike position in life has made it difficult for her to learn to empathize with others.


## EMPATHY Conflict?
Kadet used to look down on humans as servants. Since [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) has taught her how poorly some cats have been treated by humans, she has become incredibly angry with them, and she intends on putting them back in their place. 

>[!Note]+ Mastery of EMPATHY - Moondog
> Maybe Kadet, having been in CATT HELL for so long, has mastered EMPATHY, but uses it for evil? She uses it to get what she want, exactly toeing the line to avoid *actually* hurting people, while still reaping the benefits of it? If you've ever heard someone IRL say "I'm an empath", Kadet is kind of like that.


## Poshya's Conflict?
Kadet fully expects Poshya to serve her. Kadet might impart some of her wisdom upon Poshya, but not out of some good heart. She might help Poshya in return for a favour, or because she looks upon Poshya with pity.

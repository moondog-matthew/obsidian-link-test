# Story
Bittles is only an honorary CATT. He is on his 9th life, and has figured out how to visit CATT HELL early, while still being a living cat. He can even bring Poshya with him. He acts as an elderly and wise mentor to Poshya. He understands the conflicts of Poshya and CATT HELL, but does not intervene himself.

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Bittles understands the conflict, and has brought Poshya to CATT HELL, hoping they can help resolve it. 
## Poshya's Conflict?
Bittles mostly helps Poshya out IRL, and regulates when Poshya can visit and leave CATT HELL. Bittles tries to teach Poshya the importance of not carrying too much weight, to not cause burnout.

# Appearance
Bittles is a stray adopted cat of regular size.

>I imagine Bittles has black fur and one eye, like my cat, but Bittles' eye was probably taken out by another cat's attack with their claw.






> [!note]+ Moondog - Bittles' name.
> I'm not sure about this name "Bittles". I don't hate it, but I think we can come up with something better. Especially if we end up naming the CATTLANG Brrristle or something close to Bittles' name.

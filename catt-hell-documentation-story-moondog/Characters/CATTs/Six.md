# Story
Short for "Six Minutes before bedtime", in life, they helped provide their owner a sense of structure in life. Their owner had to regularly feed and take care of this cat, which they picked up on and learned from. Now as a CATT, Six sees Poshya struggle with the same problems, and tries to help them do the same thing their owner did in life, although Six can't separate their owners' personal silly rituals from the actual useful stuff.

>Why is Six in CATT HELL?
## EMPATHY Conflict?
Six understands EMPATHY isn't punishment. Six tries to do their best to be good.

## Poshya's Conflict?
Six is happy to teach Poshya about self-care, how it might be boring but ultimately worth doing. This is done through Six hyper fixating on chores and the tiniest details, which Poshya thinks is kind of silly but goes along with it to make Six happy.

>Kochmach named them "6 Minutes", but I think having another name start with a number, when we already have [10,000 Bricks](10,000%20Bricks.md), is a bit much, so I spelled out "Six".

> I think a fourth wall break such as the image above would be very funny as a one-off thing. Perhaps the player can ask Butterstick to move his ears out of the way of the dialogue behind him.
# Story
Butterstick is very friendly. He's a bit nerdy and [Autism](Autism.md###Butterstick)-coded. He will go on for too long sometimes, speaking at lengths about topics he's interested in, such as [Philosophy](Philosophy.md). 
Butterstick can't read, he *literally* devours books to learn their contents.
Butterstick is best friends with [Legally Distinct Orange Cat](Legally%20Distinct%20Orange%20Cat.md).

>[!question]+ Why is Butterstick in CATT HELL?
>>[!note]+ Moondog
>>He might be lacking empathy, not because he's a bad person or anything, but just because he has a hard time learning/understanding emotions?

## EMPATHY Conflict?
Is deeply worried about [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md). Has tried to use rationality arguments to cool him down, but hasn't succeeded.

## Poshya's Conflict?
Butterstick tries to help Poshya with encyclopedic knowledge he's learned from devouring books. It's probably not very useful, but if Poshya wants someone to bounce ideas with, he's the guy.

# Appearance
Butterstick wears a bowtie or some other silly piece of clothing their owner gave them in life. It should show that Butterstick is a nerd.

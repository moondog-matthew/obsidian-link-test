# In Medias Res Start vs. Cutscene Start?
>[!note]+ This file's purpose - Moondog
> We need either a good In Medias Res start for the game, or a good cold opening/cutscene. This is a discussion page for the topic.




>[!question]+ Should we have a cold open/cutscene? What could we do with one?
>>[!Note]+ In Medias Res start in the CATT HELL realm - Moondog
>> If we don't want to explore Poshya's real life too much, we could have Bittles' adoption and them entering CATT HELL together as a cutscene.

>>(Read my analysis of it in the foldable callout further down)
>>We can use an opening like Disco Elysium does to explore topics, probably ones related to depression, that would be difficult to explore just with dialogue with humans and CATTs.
>>
>>If we wanted to do something similar to DE, we could research the biological/physiological consequences of living with depression, e.g. ["Thereâ€™s growing evidence that several parts of the brain shrink in people with depression"](https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-physical-effects-brain) and try to go over them in the opening scene. 


>[!question]+ Do we have examples of where having one worked well? Things to take inspiration from?
>>[!Note]+ Analyzing Disco Elysium's Cold Open - Moondog
>>Most of Disco Elysium revolves around exploring Harry's inner psyche, speaking in dialogue to the voices in his head. In order to set the stage for this adventure in his mind, the opening scene is about conversing with the *subliminal* systems, the essential bodily functions. There's a great quote in it from Harry's limbic system: "**Mother, help me, there's a head attached to my neck and I'm *in* it!**" 
>>
>>Disco Elysium has an unusual stage where most of the narrative takes place, so it has an unsual opening scene.

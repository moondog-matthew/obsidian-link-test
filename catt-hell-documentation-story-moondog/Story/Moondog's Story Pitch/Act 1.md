>[!note]+ On this work's quality - Moondog
>This is my second draft. This isn't in incredible detail yet, because I'm not sure how much we all like the themes here. I can totally add more detailed prose and dialogue options later.
# Synopsis
This is a short (15~ minutes of gameplay) real-world segment. We meet [Poshya](Poshya.md), who struggles with [Depression](Depression.md) (including oversleeping, social withdrawal, substance abuse, and negative self talk), as well as one of Pos' best friends, [Ana](Ana.md), and [Bittles](Bittles.md), who Pos brings home.
This act, depending on the readers' interpretation, can include minor [Transgender](Transgender.md) themes.
# Scenes

## 1- Waking Up
Poshya is awoken as "[Dad](Dad.md)", their stepfather, gives Pos some money (in slight excess) to go buy cigarettes for him. When Poshya looks at their clock or the light outside, it's already super late. All of today's hours of daylight have already passed in their [Fictional-Eastern-European Country](Background.md).

>[!note]+ Subtext - Poshya's dad
>Poshya's stepfather is the archetypal strong silent man. He suffers from depression too, but isn't able to talk about his feelings. Poshya doesn't think about the fact that their dad is going through the same thing. He wants to help Poshya out of his slump, and he wants Poshya to be happy, but this is expressed only very subtly at the beginning. "Dad" could get the cigarettes himself, but he wants Poshya to get some fresh air, and he gives Pos some extra money to get themselves a small treat.
## 2 - Meeting Ana
It's frigid cold out. On the way to the store, Poshya meets [Ana](Ana.md). 

>[!note]+ Subtext - Ana
>Poshya and Ana were friends through all of high school. They haven't spoken much since they graduated together last year and Pos went off to study, despite living right close by to each other

She offers her old friend a cigarette. Poshya can't resist accepting it.

>[!note]+ Dialogue
>We can't fully illustrate dialogue trees in a markdown file, but this does the job for a basic scene. I imagine clicking on a greyed-out dialogue options makes a little mechanical *click* noise.
>>[!note]+ Introductions
>>ANA: Poshie!? Is that you? It's been so long, oh my goodness!
>>*Ana runs in to give you a hug. 
>>Only now when you feel her warm embrace, do you realise how cold it was out before. You should've put a sweater on under that jacket...*
>>>[!note]+ Dialogue: It's been a year, yeah... I'm sorry, I really should've texted you more.
>>>
>>
>
>>[!note]+ Poshya and the cigarette.
>>ANA: You want a smoke?
>>>[!note] Dialogue - Oh, I kind of quit a while ago since none of my friends at uni smoked... (Greyed Out)
>>
> >>[!note] Dialogue - \[SUBSTANCE ABUSE]: *Take the cigarette.* 
> >
> >> [!note] I don't know.., you'll probably enjoy those more than I will. (Greyed Out)
>> 
>
>>[!note]+ It's been a while...
>>>[!Note] Dialogue -  \[SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL]: Do you maybe want to go to see if those swings we used to play on are still there? (Greyed Out)
>>
>>>[!Note] I should really get going, the store's going to close soon...
>> 
>> ANA: Yeah, my mom's waiting for me too...
>
>> [!question]+ Gameplay vs. Story -  Moondog
>> Presenting dialogue options like \[SUBSTANCE ABUSE]  might be too gamey (instead of artistic). It's not too dissimilar to what's done in Fallout New Vegas or Disco Elysium, but dialogue options that basically say \[YOU'RE DEPRESSED] might be too on-the-nose. Maybe those things on brackets aren't shown to the player- If so, they're still useful for us as devs. We could keep a running track of how many times someone picks a \[NEGATIVE SELF-TALK option], and then later have dialogue that mentions how much negative self-talk Poshya is doing.

## 3 - At the store
Poshya sees Bittles on the way to the store, but doesn't actively stop to look at him closely.
Poshya buys cigarettes (Or not, depending on the player.)
>[!note]+ Technical Limitations & Scope
>This scene could just be dialogue or it could be a whole shop interface. If we can afford to make a shop interface, it'd be interesting to list different items that Poshya can use later in the story. I write the next scene with the assumption that we can make such a store.

## 4 - Meeting Bittles
Poshya sees the same stray cat again they saw on the way to the store, still there.
>[!Note]+ Dialogue Scene Begins 
>*You remember this cat from before you left for university, over a year ago. It looks in rougher shape now than it has ever been. It's become skinnier, and has lost an eye.*
>>[!Note]+ \[CAT FOOD]: *Feed the cat*.
>>(This option is greyed out if Poshya did not buy cat food at the store.)
>>
>>*You open the can of food, and place it in front of the stray. It seems reluctant, and fearful of strangers. You see a faint pain in his eyes as he steps forward to have a bite.*
>
>>[!Note]+ \[SNACK]: *Feed the cat a bit of your pastry.*
>>(This option is completely invisible if Poshya did not buy a snack at the store.)
>>
>>This really isn't too good for you kitty, but I guess you can have just a little bit...
>>
>>*You rip off a tiny piece of your pastry, and place it in front of the stray. It seems reluctant, and fearful of strangers. You see a faint pain in his eyes as he steps forward to have a bite.*
>>
>>Cat can have a little bit of my snack, as a treat.
>
>>[!Note}]+ \[CIGARETTES]: *Give the cat a cigarette.*
>> *You squat down to the cat's level and grab your lighter.*
>>Huh? What am I doing? Cats can't smoke. 
>>
>>>[!Note]+ You're right, what am I thinking? 
>>>(Abandon Thought).
>>
>>>[!Note]+ \[ABSURDISM]: This isn't a cigarette.
>>>We've talked about this. Too much derealization isn't good for you. You should stop now, while you still can.
>>>
>>>>[!Note]+ \[ABSURDISM]: Ceci n'est pas une cigarette?
>>>>>[!Note}+ \[NEGATIVE SELF-TALK] I'm not RenÃ© Magritte.  I'm an unemployed dropout.
>>>>>(Poshya takes 1 point of damage to their mental health. Or maybe they don't, maybe there's no mechanical consequences until you enter CATT HELL.)
>>>
>>>>[!Note]+ \[IDEOLOGY] What are you, the thought police?
>>>>> [!Note]+ \[NEGATIVE SELF-TALK] Yes. You're under arrest for suspicion of being a talentless hack.
>>>>>(Poshya takes 1 point of damage to their mental health.)
>>>
>>>>[!Note]+ Yeah, I guess you're right. I should really head home. 
>>>>(Abandon Thought)
>
>The cat follows you. It seems intent on coming home with you.
>>[!note]+ \[EMPATHY]: You're going to freeze out here if you stay, you've already lost an eye, kitty. *Pick up the cat, and bring it home with you.*


## 5 - Home

Poshya's parents see them come home with Bittles.
>[!note]+ Dialogue Scene Begins
>MOM: "Oh, you brought a friend..."
>DAD: "You didn't think maybe you'd talk to us before adopting a cat?"
>
>>[!note]+ He was going to freeze outside! 
>>DAD: Now if we have to feed him as well, we're all going to freeze, did you think of that?
>>>[!note]+ \[EMPATHY] I'll share my meals with him then!
>>> *Your stepfather begins to open his mouth again. Your mother makes a motion at him, and he lets it go.*
>
>>[!note]+ Come on, look at him, how can you say no to that?
>>DAD: This one looks like he's sick. Did you find him in the dumpster?
>>>[!Note]+ \[EMPATHY] I can clean after him and nurse him to health!
>>>*Your stepfather begins to open his mouth again. Your mother makes a motion at him, and he lets it go.*

Poshya gives "dad" the cigarettes.
> [!note]+ Dialogue
>> [!note]+ \[CIGARETTES]: Hand "Dad" the cigarettes (If Poshya did not buy cigarettes, this dialogue option is greyed out).
> >*Your stepfather smiles.*
> >DAD: Thank you, my \[CENSORED].
> >>[!question]+ Why is that censored? What is "Dad" calling Poshya? 
> >>Poshya has been practicing for a while to fully block out the sound of what "Dad" calls them. 
> >>
> >>- "Dearest"/"Beloved/Child". Poshya might feel that their stepfather's version of love is nothing like what their real dad gives them. Poshya doesn't see "Dad" as their real dad, and tries to block out the idea of that relation.
> >>- "Girl"/"Boy". See [Transgender](Transgender.md).
> >>- "Daughter"/"Son". The two above ideas combined.
> 
> >[!note]+ Oh... right, the cigarettes, I completely forgot, I'm sorry.
> > *Your stepfather sighs audibly, and begins putting his boots on. He mumbles something to himself.* I hope you spent that money on cat food, at least...
> 
> > [!Note]+ \[NEGATIVE SELF-TALK] I'm such a fucking idiot, I forgot, I'm sorry.
> > DAD: You've got that right, at least.
> > MOM, FROM THE OTHER ROOM: DON'T TALK LIKE THAT, NEITHER OF YOU!


## 6 - Sleep
Poshya goes to sleep with Bittles.

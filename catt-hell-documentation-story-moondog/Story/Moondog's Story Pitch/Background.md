Poshya is living in an eastern european country shortly after the fall of the USSR (or a fictionalized version of such a society). Due to economic shock therapy, Pos is no longer able to continue studying classical music (Piano, maybe violin?). Even if Pos could continue studying at their now-defunct university, the work prospects are bleak. Pos feels especially guilty because they have the highest education of anyone in their family, but they are not putting it to any use.

Alternative setting: The Midwest USA
Something like a dead-end town in the middle of nowhere in the midwest could work to give Poshya a depressing place to live in.

>The "Midwest Emo" genre of music is (kind of) about how much of a hellish place the midwest is to live in. Some people listen to it and then ironically(?) romanticize the same place the authors hate.

In the beginning, the A-plot in CATT HELL is Poshya's conflict, about Poshya overcoming their depression, and the B-plot is the EMPATHY conflict in CATT HELL. As Poshya gets better, the focus of the story becomes less about Poshya's depression and more about the conflict in CATT HELL.

**Poshya's Conflict**
Poshya's main conflict revolves around their battle with depression. Most CATTs in CATT HELL want to help Poshya get better, nearly all of them out of the goodness of their CATT hearts as part of their learning to live with EMPATHY. Some of those who struggle with EMPATHY either don't help Poshya, or help out of ulterior motives.


**The EMPATHY Conflict**
Some CATTs are resentful of the real world, and the humans who live there. They believe that humans do not feel EMPATHY ([Animal Abuse](Animal%20Abuse.md)), and want to get revenge on them. They attempt to rid themselves of EMPATHY, leave CATT HELL for the real world, and then wreak havoc. This will culminate with [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) (successfully?) ridding himself of EMPATHY, and Poshya having to calm him down with all she's learned.

**The Inciting Incident**
Poshya is brought to CATT HELL by Bittles. This causes strife amongst the CATTs who argue about if humans should be let in. [Gold Standard](Gold%20Standard.md) hates humans.

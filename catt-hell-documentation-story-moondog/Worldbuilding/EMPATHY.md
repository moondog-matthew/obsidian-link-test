Obviously not art we can use, just a placeholder image. EMPATHY probably won't need an image in-game, but it's nice for us.

# What is Empathy?
EMPATHY is a supernatural force in [[CATT HELL]]. 
EMPATHY: Witnessing (or causing) pain directly mirrors that pain upon those who cause it. So most CATTs have to adjust to a lifestyle of essentially not eating at all. Fortunately, CATT HELL also takes away the need for CATTs to eat, even if they don't realize it. This force also affects Poshya, and hurts them if they talk negatively about themselves.

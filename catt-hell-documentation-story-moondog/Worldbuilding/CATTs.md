**What exactly is a CATT?**
CATTs are strange extra dimensional beings, they’re ultra predators, spiritual obligate carnivores who feed off of misery and suffering. They’re spiritual entities, but to us they appear as truck-sized house cats. 

**What is the relation between CATTs and Cats?**
Cats that go to [CATT HELL](CATT%20HELL.md) and stay there a while eventually become CATTs.

**CATT names**
Most young CATTs retain their name their parents gave them. Some CATTs, especially those resentful of their human masters will change their names when they learn more about themselves. CATTs can be named after anything a human might name them, or as anything they could come up with themselves.

> I'm not too attached to the names I gave the CATTs and am fine with renaming most of them, except for maybe [Legally Distinct Orange Cat](Legally%20Distinct%20Orange%20Cat.md).

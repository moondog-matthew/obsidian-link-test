**What is CATT HELL?** Who goes there, and why?
All cats eventually go to heaven, but some must first take a trip to CATT HELL. We humans think of hell as punishment, for them it's more like a rehabilitation program. Cats that lack empathy for their fellow cat are sent here until they can behave well. In order to teach them empathy and kindness, they are forced to endure [EMPATHY](EMPATHY.md)- A fundamental force in CATT HELL, which causes pain inflicted upon others to be mirrored upon those who cause it. A prolonged time lived in CATT HELL turns regular cats into [CATTs](CATTs.md).

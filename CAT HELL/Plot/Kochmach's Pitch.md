so reading Moondog's pitch "Squished Cats RPG" kind of got me thinking about plots and aesthetics and writing, so i wanted to make this doc to write down my ideas and offer them up to the group. This is all just a proposal i think is interesting and doesn't necessarily have to be what we end up going with for Squished Cat RPG.

The core of the game would probably be a sort of stripped-down undertale clone where we play as Pos, short for 'poshya' but they insist its an acronym for 'Piece of Shit'. The tone of the story is whimsical and sometimes pretty self-depricating tone.  

Thematically the story deals with [Depression](../Themes/Depression.md), learning to live or cope with depression, self care, (excessive) self awareness, motivation, [Self-Loathing](../Themes/Self-Loathing.md) and [Nihilism](../Themes/Nihilism.md)/meaninglessness. Mostly drawing from my own experiences with depression.  

Pos is a 20 something with depression, they struggle with motivation, self loathing and nihilism and they're not in a good place mentally. They're at a pivotal point in their depression and they, for one reason or another, get a cat at this point.  

The cat is called [Bittles](../Characters/Misc/Bittles.md) (name pending), they're a rescue and they're very boring, they're also symbolic of recovering from depression. A task that is not exciting or interesting at all but rather mundane, boring and sometimes frustrating but ultimately worth doing, and interacting with bittles during 'real world' segments represents that.  

However at the same time that bittles comes into Pos' life they begin entering [CATT HELL](../Places/CATT%20HELL.md) (always spelled in all caps), CATT HELL is a strange and whimsical realm filled with giant cat creatures, the Aformentioned 'squished cats' that only speak in broken english. Kind of aesthetically inspired by stuff like LSD Dream Simulator or the ENA verse, bunch of wierd-core stuff.Â   

Despite the name CATT HELL isn't actually that hellish and looks quite pleasant. However CATT HELL works on strange physics, perceptions can become reality and vice versa, and [Self-Loathing](../Themes/Self-Loathing.md) can quite literally kill you. So dialogue or certain interactions can cause you damage. This is symbolic of how people in real life often want to help but sometimes give useless or unintentionally malicious advice. Like a therapist who hears complaints of serious long-lasting depression and just says 'go shopping' or 'do something sexy for your husband' as if that's going to fix the fact that you've been thinking about suicide because life feels utterly meaningless and you dont know how to cope.  

During Pos' journeys in CATT HELL Pos encounters various CATTs, elephant sized (or perhaps Pos just shrank) malformed cats who warp reality around them. They're all generally friendly or at their worst mercurial, none are directly hostile to Pos. they are however _dangerous_, usually unintentionally their actions or advice can cause serious harm to Pos so they have to keep on their guard up somewhat.  

You progress the story by solving puzzles, exploring CATT HELL or having philosophical converstations about life with CATTs. You go back and forth between short boring 'real world' segments where you interact with Bittles and feed him and such, then you go to sleep and you go explore in CATT HELL.  

  

**Some other stuff**  

- self awareness: Pos is aware that their own perception is warped but is too depressed and lost in their self loathing to really do anything about it. "i wouldn't treat a friend like this, but its ok when i do it to myself because i deserve it"  
    
- i know this all reads as pretty downer, but the tone should be like 70% light hearted or absuridst with the 30% being Pos' little snarky and depressive comments.  
    
- i know i said stripped-down undertale, but that's mostly aesthetics, it probably wouldn't have the bullet-hell segments at all and basically just be a conversation simulator with puzzles.  
    
- good and bad ending, get down to 0 LIFE and you wake up, have to do a chore and then go back to your depression nap, then you start the dreamworld segment over again except with 1 less max HP.
    - Lower your max hp to zero and you've completely eroded your will to live, dont exactly show what happens but the implication is suicide. That being said this ending should basically be impossible to get unless you're directly looking for it by intentionally engaging in self harming behaviour/thought/dialogue, challenge is not part of the game.
    - the good ending is just when you finish the game, leave wonderland for good and take your first serious steps on the road to recovery.  
        
- certain options should be 'greyed out', they're the best course of action but because you're too miserable you wont be able to take them. Remnicent of Depression Quest. Kind of like how the best [Self-Care](../Themes/Self-Care.md) and advice for depression usually boils down to things that are impossible to do when you're in a depression spiral. Like yeah i know exercise and getting fresh air is good for my mood, but i've been stuck in bed intensely thinking about how much i suck for 6 hours now and i'm not going to go outside.  
    
- the real world is monotone and kind of desaturated, aesthetically dreary post-soviet, CATT HELL is the total opposite being bright, saturated and full of animated stuff (scrolling textures, wacky skyboxes, etc.)  
    
- several quests/levels should involve teaching or talking about effective self care methods, either directly or metaphorically.

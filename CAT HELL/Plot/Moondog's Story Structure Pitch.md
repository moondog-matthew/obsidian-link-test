(This is unfinished.)
# Structure
The game might alternate between dialogue and puzzle/gameplay segments?
# Scope
Three chapters, and that's it. Three chapters of well-written branching dialogue is not going to be easy to make, and three minigames/puzzles of decent quality should pose a reasonable challenge, too. 

# Story
## Chapter 1
Synopsis: Pos expresses themes of [Depression](../Themes/Depression.md) (oversleeping, social withdrawal. Substance abuse and negative self-talk can be written in). Pos meets [Bittles](../Characters/Misc/Bittles.md).
### Story Segment
Pos wakes up, having slept in till 4PM.
- It is winter in [The Real World](../Places/The%20Real%20World.md), and nearly all of today's hours of daylight outside have already passed.
- Pos oversleeps a lot lately. 
"[Dad](../Characters/People/Dad.md)" (Pos' Stepfather) gives Pos some money to go pick up cigarettes for him.
- On the way there, Pos meets a long-time friend, [Ana](../Characters/People/Ana.md). They share one of her cigarettes.
	- They haven't spoken in ages, despite living close.
	- This is Pos withdrawing socially. Pos could use someone to talk to, but they feel too wracked with guilt to talk to Ana about it, because they know Ana is going through stuff herself. Pos doesn't want to give Ana any more things to worry about.
		- (The right thing to do would be for them to talk to each other about their issues. A problem shared is a problem halved, and all that. This leaves room for Pos to later express themselves to Ana, when they develop better coping mechanisms.)
		- To represent Pos wanting to talk to her about this issue but not being able to, there might be a greyed-out [Dialogue](../Gameplay%20Mechanics/Dialogue.md) option.
- Pos buys the cigarettes at the store.
	- Maybe Pos has some spare cash to buy a little extra something, that they can use later in the story?
- Pos walks back home, and meets Bittles.
	- It's freezing out, this time of year. Pos has met this cat before a few times, but wasn't sure if it was a stray cat or not. Only now Pos is sure, this cat is a stray, and they're hungry, cold, and lonely. Kind of like Pos. Pos takes the kitty home.
- Pos' parents aren't too happy with the sudden adoption. Pos makes the argument that the kitty might literally freeze to death. They allow the kitty to stay the night.

### Gameplay segment
Pos plays with Bittles? 


## Chapter 2
Synopsis: Pos enters [CATT HELL](../Places/CATT%20HELL.md). Pos speaks to wacky Catts, who help offer Pos some introspection, and their dialogue helps motivate Pos to take better care of themselves.
This chapter has a much more light-hearted tone than chapter 1.
### Story Segment:
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
### Gameplay segment:
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Chapter 3
Synopsis: Pos performs mundane tasks. Boring, but conquering these small things is the first step to getting better.

### Story Segment

Bittles makes Pos wake up much earlier in the day than they normally would.
- Maybe Bittles pees on the floor and Mom wakes them up. 
Ana texts Pos. She mentions how nice it was to see them again yesterday, they talk a bit.
### Gameplay Segment
Pos cleans up their room. 






## Chapter 4 (End of Demo)
Pos and Bittles enter CATT HELL again. The previous nights' conversation with the catts resumes and can be elaborated upon, but this is not part of the beginning scope of the game.

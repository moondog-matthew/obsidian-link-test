Pos is the protagonist, currently of ambiguous gender. Their name is short for 'Poshya', but they insist it's an acronym for "Piece of Shit". In this story, Pos is trying to learn to live with, or at least cope with, [Depression](../../Themes/Depression.md). They also suffer from [Self-Loathing](../../Themes/Self-Loathing.md) experience thoughts of [Nihilism](../../Themes/Nihilism.md)

At a pivotal point in their depression, Pos adopts a cat, [Bittles](../Misc/Bittles.md). they're a rescue and they're very boring, they're also symbolic of recovering from [Depression](../../Themes/Depression.md). A task that is not exciting or interesting at all but rather mundane, boring and sometimes frustrating but ultimately worth doing, and interacting with [Bittles](../Misc/Bittles.md) during 'real world' segments represents that.

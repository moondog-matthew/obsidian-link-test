A document to note down shared practices for using markdown files


# Leaving Comments
Format it like:
//Name: Comment

Example:
//Moondog: Maybe we shouldn't add a monty python reference here?

# File Links
Writing file links in your .md files here is optional. They are intended to make it easier to navigate files. You can click through them on GitHub and on Obsidian. Maybe on other platforms as well.


# Obsidian Guide:
## Why? 
Obsidian is a markdown file reader you can use to do some cool things, including writing links to other files very easily.

## How?
To use Obsidian, download it from here: https://obsidian.md/
After installation, go into Settings -> Files and Links and do these two things:
- Set "New Link Format" to "Relative path to file"
- Turn off "Use [[Wikilinks]]"
After you've done this, when writing in Obsidian, you can at any time write [[filename]] (the filename enclosed in two brackets) to automatically create a link to a file.
